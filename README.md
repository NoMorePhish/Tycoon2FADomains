## 🚨 About Tycoon 2FA

**Tycoon 2FA** is a sophisticated phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) platform known for targeting enterprise users and bypassing multi-factor authentication (MFA) using adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) techniques. Attackers behind Tycoon 2FA deploy phishing pages that mimic legitimate login portals (e.g., Microsoft 365, Google Workspace) and use proxy-based interception to capture credentials and session tokens.
